                   Instant Rails Release Notes
                   ===========================

Instant Rails currently has only a preview release. There are still a number
of rough edges, but it is essentially functional and usable.

Instant Rails includes a number of open source software packages. Below is a
list of all included software.

Primary Instant Rails Components
================================

    * [Instant Rails Manager] 1.0 preview3

    * [Ruby 1.8.2] (from the [One-Click Ruby Installer] 182-15)

    * [Ruby on Rails] 1.0: The Release Candidate 4 (aka 0.14.3)

    * [Apache] 1.3.33

    * [MySQL] 4.1.9

    * [SCGI] 1.7+

    * [SCGI Rails Runner] 0.4.3

    * [phpMyAdmin] 2.6.1

Ancillary Instant Rails Components
==================================

These components are not the primary focus of Instant Rails, but are included
because the primary components above depend upon them..

    * [PHP] 4.3.10

    * [Rake] 0.6.2

    * [cmdparse] 2.0.0

Notes
=====

    * Instant Rails includes the [One-Click Ruby Installer] for Windows
      which contains a number of Ruby extensions and libraries that are
      not used by Instant Rails itself. For a list of those packages,
      please refer to the One-Click Ruby Installer project.

Desired Changes for 1.0 Final Release
=====================================

    * Use Apache2 instead of Apache 1.3

    * Run SCGI Rails Runner in the background as a service.

    * Allow mutliple SCGI Rails Runner processes to service requests for
      a single Rails application. SRR already allows this on Linux, but
      it still needs to be implemented on Windows.

    * Use the C-based MySQL driver for for Ruby (currently the 
      Ruby-based driver is used).

    * Add [Typo] as a preinstalled sample app.
