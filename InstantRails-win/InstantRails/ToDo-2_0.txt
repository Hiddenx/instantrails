Instant Rails 2.0 -- To Do
==========================

* Rewrite Instant Rails Manager as a Rails app served up by WEBrick
  (this will make it cross platform).
  
* Reorganize directory structure to accomodate multiple platforms.

* Upgrade to Apache 2

* Upgrade to MySQL 5

* Upgrade to newer version of PHP.

* Allow multiple SCGI instances of a web app to run as a cluster
for increased performance.
