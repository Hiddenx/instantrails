<p></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The goal of <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> is simple, yet
ambitious: to become THE cross-platform IDE of choice for the Ruby
community. We want <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> to be a
first-class IDE on par with those available for other languages. These
goals include:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Cross-Platform</strong> -- <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>
will run on as many platforms as possible (currently runs on Linux,
Windows and Mac OS X).
  </li>
  <li> <strong>International</strong> -- <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>
will be easily translated into other languages and will include
features that make it easier to develop Ruby applications that can be
internationalized. (to be done)
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Plugin Architecture</strong> -- <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>'s plugin architecture will make
it easy for any developer to extend the features of <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Extreme Programming</strong> -- <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> will include features that make
it easy to use many practices that have been popularized by the Extreme
Programming method. This will include collaboration support for remote
pair programming, unit testing support for test-first coding,
refactoring support, and more.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Code Editing &amp; Navigation</strong> -- All the
now-standard code editing and navigation features you would find in any
high-end IDE, including syntax highlighting, code completion, template
expansion, class browsing, etc.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Please realize that this is an early release of <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> and we still have some work to do
before we realize all of these goals. However <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> is already used by many users on
a daily basis and the <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> uses it
to develop <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> of course. This
release already includes some interesting functionalities (see details
below) and an extremely flexible plugin architecture that makes it easy
to add new extensions.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This user documentation is fairly minimal. But it doesn't need to be
extensive (at least not yet), because what has been implemented so far
is very straightforward and operates pretty much like any other
GUI-based IDE or code editor. You should find its use to be familiar
and comfortable (if not, then please let us know).
</p>
<p><a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> is built on a very flexible
plugin architecture called <a href="wiki.pl?FreeBASE">FreeBASE</a>
that allows it to be easily extended. In fact, except for the code that
implements the plugin system, the entire <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>
IDE is implemented as a set of plugins. If you are interested in
creating your own plugins to add new capabilities to <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>, or if you want to join the <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> project, please read the <a
 href="wiki.pl?DeveloperDocumentation">DeveloperDocumentation</a>.
</p>
<p>The following features have been implemented in this release of <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> (0.9.3):
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Edit multiple files in a tabbed edit panel with Ruby syntax
highlighting and auto-indenting.
  </li>
  <li> Navigate within a source file using the Source Browser (a
tree-style parsing of your code showing all modules, classes, methods,
etc.).
  </li>
  <li> Run and/or Debug your code using the integrated debugger.
  </li>
  <li> File browsing
  </li>
  <li> Online Ruby documentation for Ruby standard libraries
  </li>
  <li> Embedded Interactive shell
  </li>
  <li> Code Refactoring (experimental)
  </li>
  <li> Preferences settings for the debugger, the script runner and the
editor
  </li>
  <li> For <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> developers:
visually inspect the state of the internal <a href="wiki.pl?FreeBASE">FreeBASE</a>
databus (plugin architecture) </li>
</ul>
<p>
The code editing panel is implemented using <a
 href="HTTP://www.scintilla.org/">[Scintilla]</a> and should be
familiar to anyone who has used Scite or any other Scintilla-based code
editor. It includes basic code-editing features like syntax
highlighting, auto-indenting, code(un)folding and the expected basic
navigation (Ctrl-tab to move by word, shift-key to extend selections,
tab-key to indent selections, etc.).
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Installing <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a></h2>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Using the installer</h3>
<p>
The prefered way for installing <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>
is to use the <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> installers that
we built for you. <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> installers
are currently available for Windows and Linux. A MacOS<a
 href="wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=MacOS">?</a> X installer is in
preparation. There are many advantages to using the <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> installers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> You don't have to download, compile and install all the
components needed by <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> (Fox,
FXRuby, FXscintilla...)
  </li>
  <li> The Linux installer should work on every fairly recent Linux
distro (Mandrake 9/10, SuSE<a href="wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=SuSE">?</a>
9, Fedora Core...). The Windows installer is known to work on Win 2K
and XP.
  </li>
  <li> You always have the most up to date versions of these components
and/or those supported by the <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>
team (it also makes support easier for us)
  </li>
  <li> The installers come with its own version of Ruby so you don't
have to install one if you don't want to.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> installers are available
in the <a href="HTTP://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=31">[Download]</a>
section of <a href="wiki.pl?RubyForge">RubyForge</a>. Please note if
you are a Windows users new to Ruby and don't have Ruby installed on
your machine you may want to want to install <a
 href="HTTP://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/">[one-click Ruby
installer for Windows]</a> which a comes with Ruby and many additional
packages including <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>.
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Do it yourself (are you sure?...)</h3>
Really want to do it all by yourself? Then follow the instructions
below. To run properly run <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> you
need to have Ruby 1.8.x installed. In addition, <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> also requires 3 external software
components:
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="HTTP://www.fox-toolkit.org">[FOX]</a>, a
cross-platform C/C++ GUI Toolkit that is now gaining a wide acceptance
in the Ruby community (version 1.2.x)
  </li>
  <li> <a href="HTTP://www.fxruby.org">[FXRuby]</a>, the ruby
interface to the FOX library (version 1.2.x)
  </li>
  <li> <a href="HTTP://www.nongnu.org/fxscintilla/">[FXScintilla]</a>,
a FOX port of the <a href="HTTP://www.scintilla.org/">[Scintilla]</a>
widget editor (version 1.59 or above)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For Windows users, the easiest way is to install the Ruby one-click
installer for Windows (see in the previous section). It includes <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> and it is quite easy to update
only the Ruby source code without changing your Ruby installer.
</p>
<p>For Linux users it is very likely that your favorite distro comes
with the FOX toolkit either already installed or available as a
contributed package. FXRuby and FXscintilla are available on their
respective projects web site (see hyperlinks above).
</p>
<p>If <a href="HTTP://www.fox-toolkit.org/">[Fox]</a>, <a
 href="HTTP://www.nongnu.org/fxscintilla/">[fxscintilla]</a> or <a
 href="HTTP://www.fxruby.org/">[FXRuby]</a> rpms are not available for
your distribution, you'll need to build them from source. <a
 href="HTTP://www.fox-toolkit.org/">[Fox]</a> is normally installed as
would be expected:
</p>
<p></p>
<pre>        tar xzf fox-1.2.x.tar.gz<br>	cd fox-1.2.x<br>	./configure <br>	make<br>	make install<br></pre>
<p>
Gentoo users: You need to emerge fxscintilla before fxruby. Or, if you
already have fxruby installed, you have to re-emerge fxruby after
emerging fxscintilla. The reason is, the emerge (or the ./configure
itself?) autodetects the presence of fxscintilla when doing the fxruby
build. If it's not there, your fxruby build won't have fxscintilla "in
it", and <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> will crash when
trying to open/edit files.
</p>
<p>The rest of the installation is as per a normal linux install,
firstly <a href="HTTP://www.nongnu.org/fxscintilla/">[fxscintilla]</a>:
</p>
<p></p>
<pre>	tar xzf fxscintilla-1.62.tar.gz<br>	cd fxscintilla-1.62<br>	./configure<br>	make<br>	make install<br></pre>
<p>
then <a href="HTTP://www.fxruby.org/">[FXRuby]</a>:
</p>
<p></p>
<pre>	tar xzf FXRuby-1.2.4.tar.gz<br>	cd FXRuby-1.2.4<br>	ruby install.rb config -- --with-fxscintilla-include=/usr/local/include/fxscintilla --with-fxscintilla-lib=/usr/local/lib<br>	ruby install.rb setup<br>	ruby install.rb install<br></pre>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CAUTION!!* If you leave out the '--with-fxscintilla-xxx' options
it will *not* build FXScintilla support into FXRuby and as a result <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> will not work.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> also relies on a number of
other Ruby packages but they come with the <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>
software (redist directory). The reason why we did that is:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> to make installation easier
  </li>
  <li> to make sure that <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> uses
the right version of the package
  </li>
  <li> minize <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> impact on your
Ruby installation.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Running <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a></h2>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Starting <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a></h3>
<p>
The directory in which you installed <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>
contains a system script named "run.bat" that will start <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>. In Linux you would use 'sh
run.bat' and in Windows you can simply execute this script directly. If
you used the Windows installer click on the bulleye icon to start <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>. If you used the Linux installer
the command to run is given at the end of the installation script. If
you use a KDE or Gnome compliant window manager the bulleye icon will
also appear on your desktop.
</p>
<p><a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> is entirely written in Ruby
so, depending on the speed of your computer, it may take a while for <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> to start up. Once <a
 href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> has started, however, performance
should be good.
</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> Layout</h3>
<p>
The first time <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> is launched, a
window will pop up with a menu bar at the top and the tool ber right
below. At the bottom of the screen is a status where you will see
status messages displayed in the course of your work session. These can
be information, warning or error messages. So keep an eye on it!
</p>
<p>At the center of the page is an empty grey zone where editor windows
will appear when you create or open ruby files. On the borders of the
editor zones are three areas called 'dockpanes'. They are initially
invisible but they will show up as soon as you launch new services.
There are 3 dockbars: one on the left called the West dockbar, one on
the right called the East dockbar and one at the botton called the
South dockbar. (see illustration below)
</p>
<p></p>
<pre> +-------------------------------------------------------------------+<br> |             Menu Bar (menu entries and commands)                  |<br> +-------------------------------------------------------------------+<br> |             Tool bar (icons shortcut to commands)                 |<br> +-------------------------------------------------------------------+<br> |            |                                         |            |<br> |            |                                         |            |<br> |            |                                         |            |<br> |            |                                         |            |<br> |   West     |                                         |   East     |<br> |            |             Editor pane                 |            |<br> |  Dockbar   |                                         |  Dockbar   |<br> |            |                                         |            |<br> |            |                                         |            |<br> |            |                                         |            |<br> |            |                                         |            |<br> |            |                                         |            |<br> +-------------------------------------------------------------------+<br> |                                                                   |<br> |                                                                   |<br> |                      South Dockbar                                |<br> |                                                                   |<br> |                                                                   |<br> +-------------------------------------------------------------------+<br> |                        Status bar (messages)                      |<br> +-------------------------------------------------------------------+<br></pre>
<p>
As you run new services (file browser, source browser, IRB...) they
will show up in the form of 'dockpanes' that docks into one of the 3
dockbars. As an example you may click on View -&gt; File List or type
the Ctrl-L shortcut. The File browser will pop up and immediatyely dock
into the West dockbar. A dockpane can be undocked and redocked at any
time. To play with this feature you can click on the leftmost icon in
the title bar of the file browser. The File browser will become an
independent window that you can move and resize at will. Similarly you
can redock it by clicking again on the same icon.
</p>
<p><a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> remembers the position and
size of all the undocked dockpanes. So the next time you undock the
same service it will take the excat same geometry as before. Similarly
when restarting <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> all undocked
services will automatically place themselves where they where when you
stopped <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>A sample <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> session</h2>
<p>
Before we go into more details about the <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>
features, let's go through a sample coding session to give you a flavor
a what <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> can do for you:
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Creating a new file</h3>
<p>
The first thing you'll want to do is to create a new file. Click on
File -&gt; New: a new empty editor window named 'Untitled 1' is
created. Type the following code in the empty editor window:
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Click on File -&gt; Save and navigate in a working directory of your
choice where you'll save the file with the name 'buffer.rb'.
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Navigating the source code</h3>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Using the Ruby documentation</h3>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Running the script</h3>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Debugging the script</h3>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Customizing the editor</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<h3>The Refactor Menu</h3>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>NOTE* As stated at the top of the menu, the refactoring
capabilities are highly experimental. They need thorough testing and
your help is really appreciated.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <em>Rename Local Variable</em> -- Rename the local variable on
which the cursor was placed or that was selected with the mouse. The

the method currently belongs to.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The View Menu</h3>
<p>
SOme items of the View menu may be greyed meaning that the

<h2>The Source Browser</h2>
<p>
The Source Browser helps shows you the structure of your source code
and lets you jump directly to differently parts of your source code. It
does this by parsing your source code and displaying an outline of the
contents of your source code as hierarchical tree. Clicking on an item
in the tree (like a method name or a class name) will cause the editing
pane to jump directly to that item in your source code.
</p>
<p>The Source Browser occupies a docked window pane the runs down the
left side of the <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> window (if
the Source Browser is not visible, you may need to use you mouse to
grab the splitter bar at the left of the editing pane and drag it to
the right).
</p>
<p>Currently, you must manually force the Source Browser to refresh
(reparse the source code) after you have made changes to your source
code. This is a temporary measure that was needed to maintain adequate
performance. The long term goal is to make this completely automatic.
</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>
(to be written) ? Note: shift-click left button mouse in the margin of
the editor to set or clear a breakpoint.

<h2>The Databus Inspector</h2>
<p>
The Databus Inspector is a GUI tool for interactively exploring the
current state of the internal Databus that is the central
communications hub for all <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a>
plugins. This will only be of interest to developers who are creating
and debugging <a href="wiki.pl?FreeRIDE">FreeRIDE</a> plugins.
</p>
<p>Please see the developer documentation (<a href="wiki.pl?DevDoc">DevDoc</a>)
for more details about the Databus.
