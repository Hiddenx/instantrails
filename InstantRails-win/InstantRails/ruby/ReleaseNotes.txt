1.  You can install overtop of an existing installation that has
the same Ruby major version number (e.g., 1.6).  Installations
up to and including 1.6.5-1 can only be uninstalled.  All versions
can co-exist peacefully (DLL's willing) in separate directories.

2. This version was compiled using Microsoft Visual C++, not Cygwin.
As a result, some I/O functionality -- particularly those involving
the Unix fork() system call and pipes -- will not work. The benefit
of using MSVC is to have a more stable and reliable version of Ruby.

Change Log:
-----------
Release 1.8.2-15:
- Added fxri 0.3.2
- Updated FXRuby 1.2.6
- Updated FreeRIDE to 0.9.4
- Updated RubyGems to 0.8.10
- Created start menu shortcuts for RubyGems gem_server 
  and viewing the RDoc for installed gems.
- Included new build of readline 4.3.2 
  (I hope this fixes readline problems)
- Included user-submitted irb patch
- Included ruby/misc/ruby-electric.el from Ruby 1.9 
- Included testunit patch needed by Rails


Release 1.8.2-14:
- This is a build of Ruby 1.8.2 preview3.
- Upgraded FXRuby to version 1.2.2
- Added RubyGems 0.8.1
- Added FreeRIDE 0.9.0
- Added Start Menu shortcuts to documentation on ruby-doc.org.
- Eliminated the installer dialog message that warned you 
  might need to reboot your system. This allows for unattended 
  installs   using the command-line arguments:
      /S /D=<install dir>
- Changed the layout of the Windows registry entries.  
- Fixed a typo in a windows registry entry (bug 643).
- Upgraded Expat to version 1.95.7
- Upgraded Ruby-odbc to version 0.993
- Upgraded DBI to 0.23


Release 1.8.1-13:
- Included the win32ole from 1.8.1-10 because the win32ole as
  distributed in Ruby 1.8.1 is broken.
- Hand generated the RI database from a post 1.8.1 Ruby snapshot
  (because RI in the Ruby 1.8.1 release tarball was broken).
  RI still crashes for names that are all uppercase letters, so
  you can't run RI on CGI or IO.
- Fixed the bad paths in the *.bat files in ruby\bin.
- Log4R was broken in the Ruby 1.8.1 distribution. Tis was fixed
  by applying this patch:
  http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/80495
- Win32api is present in this distribution, but broken. It will not
  be fixed because Win32api hass been deprecated and you should use
  Ruby/DL instead. See:
  http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/94569


Release 1.8.1-12:
- Eradicated all uses of cygwin
- Now using the version of REXML that is distributed with Ruby.
- Upgraded SciTE to version 1.59, which includes support for YAML
  highlighting and Tools menu commands for Ruby syntax checking,
  code profiling, and irb.


Release 1.8.1-11:
- Initial release of 1.8.1 version of Ruby


Release 1.8.0-10:
- First stable version of 1.8.
- Removed spurious win32ole.


Release 1.8.0-9:

- Preview-2 snapshot from 4/11/2003
- New versions of most packages.
