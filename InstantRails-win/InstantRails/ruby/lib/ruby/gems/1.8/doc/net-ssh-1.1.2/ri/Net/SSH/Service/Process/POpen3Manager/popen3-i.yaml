  body: Invokes the given command synchronously on the current connection. (This means that parallel commands and operations cannot be executed when this method is used.) This will return <tt>nil</tt> if the method could not be executed. If the command is successfully invoked, and a block is given, the block is then invoked with the input, output, and error streams of the command as parameters, and the channel is closed as soon as the block terminates. If a block is not given, the input, output, and error channels are returned and the process <b>might</b> not terminate until the session itself terminates.
