- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Active Records will automatically record creation and/or update timestamps of database objects if fields of the names created_at/created_on or updated_at/updated_on are present. This module is automatically included, so you don't need to do that manually.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This behavior can be turned off by setting <tt>ActiveRecord::Base.record_timestamps = false</tt>. This behavior by default uses local time, but can use UTC by setting <tt>ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone = :utc</tt>
