  body: "This allows new interceptors to be defined &quot;on-the-fly&quot;. The associated block must accept two parameters--an object representing the chain of interceptors, and the context of the current method invocation. The block should then invoke #process_next on the chain (passing the context as the lone parameter) when the next element of the chain should be invoked."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "You should only call #doing once per interceptor, and never after invoking #with on the same interceptor."
