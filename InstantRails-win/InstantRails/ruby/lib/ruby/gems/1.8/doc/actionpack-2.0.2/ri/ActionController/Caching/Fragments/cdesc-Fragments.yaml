  body: "Fragment caching is used for caching various blocks within templates without caching the entire action as a whole. This is useful when certain elements of an action change frequently or depend on complicated state while other parts rarely change or can be shared amongst multiple parties. The caching is doing using the cache helper available in the Action View. A template with caching might look something like:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  <b>Hello &lt;%= @name %&gt;</b>\n  &lt;% cache do %&gt;\n    All the topics in the system:\n    &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; &quot;topic&quot;, :collection =&gt; Topic.find(:all) %&gt;\n  &lt;% end %&gt;\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This cache will bind to the name of the action that called it, so if this code was part of the view for the topics/list action, you would be able to invalidate it using <tt>expire_fragment(:controller =&gt; &quot;topics&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;list&quot;)</tt>.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "This default behavior is of limited use if you need to cache multiple fragments per action or if the action itself is cached using <tt>caches_action</tt>, so we also have the option to qualify the name of the cached fragment with something like:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  &lt;% cache(:action =&gt; &quot;list&quot;, :action_suffix =&gt; &quot;all_topics&quot;) do %&gt;\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: That would result in a name such as &quot;/topics/list/all_topics&quot;, avoiding conflicts with the action cache and with any fragments that use a different suffix. Note that the URL doesn't have to really exist or be callable - the url_for system is just used to generate unique cache names that we can refer to when we need to expire the cache.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "The expiration call for this example is:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  expire_fragment(:controller =&gt; &quot;topics&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;list&quot;, :action_suffix =&gt; &quot;all_topics&quot;)\n"

    body: "FileStore: Keeps the fragments on disk in the <tt>cache_path</tt>, which works well for all types of environments and allows all processes running from the same application directory to access the cached content."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "MemoryStore: Keeps the fragments in memory, which is fine for WEBrick and for FCGI (if you don't care that each FCGI process holds its own fragment store). It's not suitable for CGI as the process is thrown away at the end of each request. It can potentially also take up a lot of memory since each process keeps all the caches in memory."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "DRbStore: Keeps the fragments in the memory of a separate, shared DRb process. This works for all environments and only keeps one cache around for all processes, but requires that you run and manage a separate DRb process."
