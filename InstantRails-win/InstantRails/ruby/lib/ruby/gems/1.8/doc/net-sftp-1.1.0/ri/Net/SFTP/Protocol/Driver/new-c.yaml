  body: Create a new SFTP protocol driver object on the given SSH connection. <tt>buffers</tt> is a reference to a buffer factory, <tt>version</tt> is the highest supported SFTP protocol version, <tt>dispatchers</tt> is a Proc object that returns a dispatcher instance for a specific protocol version, and <tt>log</tt> is a logger instance.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The new protocol driver will be in an <tt>unconfirmed</tt> state, initially. When the server validates the requested channel, the driver goes to the <tt>init</tt> state, and requests the SFTP subsystem. When the subsystem has been accepted, the driver sends its supported protocol version to the server, and goes to the <tt>version</tt> state. Lastly, when the server responds with its supported protocol version and the version to use has been successfully negotiated, the driver will go to the <tt>open</tt> state, after which SFTP operations may be successfully performed on the driver.
