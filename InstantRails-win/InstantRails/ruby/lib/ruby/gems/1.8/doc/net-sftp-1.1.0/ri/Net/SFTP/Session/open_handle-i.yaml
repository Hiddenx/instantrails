  body: Opens the given remote file and returns a handle to it, which may be used with other operations (read, write, etc.). If a block is given, the handle will be yielded to it and closed when the block finishes, otherwise the handle will be returned. If the flags parameter is a numeric value, it must be a combination of IO constants, otherwise, it should be a string such as given to File.open.
