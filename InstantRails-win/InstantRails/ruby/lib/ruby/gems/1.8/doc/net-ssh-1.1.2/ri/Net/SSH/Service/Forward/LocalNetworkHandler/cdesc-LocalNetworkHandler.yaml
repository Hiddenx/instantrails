  body: This is a utility class used internally by Forward::Driver. It manages the network server instance for each locally forwarded port, and is passed as the handler to Driver#direct_channel by Forward::Driver#forward_local. Other clients may desire to extend this class and pass the modified class to Forward::Driver#direct_channel for their own purposes, but in general this class will rarely be used outside of Forward::Driver.
