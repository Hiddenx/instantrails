comment: 
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: A &quot;service point&quot; is a definition of a service. Just as a class defines the behavior of an object, so does a service point describe a service. In particular, a service point also knows how to instantiate a service.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: A ServicePoint should never be directly instantiated. Instead, define services via the interfaces provided by Container.
