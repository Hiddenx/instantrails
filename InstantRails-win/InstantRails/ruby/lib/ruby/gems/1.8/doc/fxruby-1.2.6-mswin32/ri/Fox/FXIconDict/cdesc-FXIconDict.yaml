- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: An FXIconDict instance stores a mapping between the file names for icon files and FXIcon instances built from those icon files. Unlike a regular &quot;dictionary&quot; or hash-like object, the FXIconDict constructs and owns its own data (the FXIcon instances).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If no icon path is specified at construction time, a default icon path of &quot;~/.foxicons:/usr/local/share/icons:/usr/share/icons&quot; is used.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The particular subclass of FXIcon used for a given icon file is deduced from the file extension.
