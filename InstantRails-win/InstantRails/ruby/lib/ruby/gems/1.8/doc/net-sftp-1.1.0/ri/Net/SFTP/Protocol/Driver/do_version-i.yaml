  body: This is used internally to indicate that a VERSION packet was received from the server. This may only be called when the driver's state is <tt>version</tt>. It determines the highest possible protocol version supported by both the client and the server, selects the dispatcher that handles that protocol version, moves the state to <tt>open</tt>, and then invokes the <tt>on_open</tt> callback (if one was registered).
