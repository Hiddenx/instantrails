  body: The MDI client window manages a number of MDI child windows in a multiple-document interface (MDI) application. MDI child windows usually receive messages from the GUI through delegation via the MDI client, i.e. the MDI client window is set as the target for most GUI commands; the MDI client filters out a few messages and forwards all other messages to the active MDI child. MDI client can arrange the MDI child windows in various ways:- it may maximize one of the MDI child windows, arrange them side-by-side, cascade them, or iconify them. MDI child windows are notified about changes in the active MDI child window by the MDI client.
