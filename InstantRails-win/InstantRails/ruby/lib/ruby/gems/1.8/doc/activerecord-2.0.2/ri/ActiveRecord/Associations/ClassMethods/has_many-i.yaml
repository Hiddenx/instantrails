  body: "Adds the following methods for retrieval and query of collections of associated objects: <tt>collection</tt> is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument, so <tt>has_many :clients</tt> would add among others <tt>clients.empty?</tt>."
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST

  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection(force_reload = false)</tt> - returns an array of all the associated objects. An empty array is returned if none are found.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection&lt;&lt;(object, ...)</tt> - adds one or more objects to the collection by setting their foreign keys to the collection's primary key.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.delete(object, ...)</tt> - removes one or more objects from the collection by setting their foreign keys to NULL. This will also destroy the objects if they're declared as <tt>belongs_to</tt> and dependent on this model.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection=objects</tt> - replaces the collections content by deleting and adding objects as appropriate.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection_singular_ids</tt> - returns an array of the associated objects' ids
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection_singular_ids=ids</tt> - replace the collection with the objects identified by the primary keys in <tt>ids</tt>
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.clear</tt> - removes every object from the collection. This destroys the associated objects if they are associated with <tt>:dependent =&gt; :destroy</tt>, deletes them directly from the database if <tt>:dependent =&gt; :delete_all</tt>, otherwise sets their foreign keys to NULL.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.empty?</tt> - returns <tt>true</tt> if there are no associated objects.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.size</tt> - returns the number of associated objects.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.find</tt> - finds an associated object according to the same rules as Base.find.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.build(attributes = {}, ...)</tt> - returns one or more new objects of the collection type that have been instantiated with <tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through a foreign key, but have not yet been saved. *Note:* This only works if an associated object already exists, not if it's <tt>nil</tt>!
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.create(attributes = {})</tt> - returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated with <tt>attributes</tt>, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that has already been saved (if it passed the validation). *Note:* This only works if an associated object already exists, not if it's <tt>nil</tt>!

- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Options are:"
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:class_name</tt> - specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred from the association name. So <tt>has_many :products</tt> will by default be linked to the <tt>Product</tt> class, but if the real class name is <tt>SpecialProduct</tt>, you'll have to specify it with this option.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:conditions</tt> - specify the conditions that the associated objects must meet in order to be included as a <tt>WHERE</tt> SQL fragment, such as <tt>price &gt; 5 AND name LIKE 'B%'</tt>.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:order</tt> - specify the order in which the associated objects are returned as an <tt>ORDER BY</tt> SQL fragment, such as <tt>last_name, first_name DESC</tt>
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:foreign_key</tt> - specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name of this class in lower-case and <tt>_id</tt> suffixed. So a <tt>Person</tt> class that makes a <tt>has_many</tt> association will use <tt>person_id</tt> as the default <tt>foreign_key</tt>.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:dependent</tt> - if set to <tt>:destroy</tt> all the associated objects are destroyed alongside this object by calling their destroy method. If set to <tt>:delete_all</tt> all associated objects are deleted <b>without</b> calling their destroy method. If set to <tt>:nullify</tt> all associated objects' foreign keys are set to <tt>NULL</tt> <b>without</b> calling their save callbacks.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:finder_sql</tt> - specify a complete SQL statement to fetch the association. This is a good way to go for complex associations that depend on multiple tables. Note: When this option is used, <tt>find_in_collection</tt> is <em>not</em> added."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:counter_sql</tt> - specify a complete SQL statement to fetch the size of the association. If <tt>:finder_sql</tt> is specified but not <tt>:counter_sql</tt>, <tt>:counter_sql</tt> will be generated by replacing <tt>SELECT ... FROM</tt> with <tt>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM</tt>.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:extend</tt> - specify a named module for extending the proxy. See &quot;Association extensions&quot;.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:include</tt> - specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when the collection is loaded.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:group</tt>: An attribute name by which the result should be grouped. Uses the <tt>GROUP BY</tt> SQL-clause."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:limit</tt>: An integer determining the limit on the number of rows that should be returned."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:offset</tt>: An integer determining the offset from where the rows should be fetched. So at 5, it would skip the first 4 rows."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:select</tt>: By default, this is <tt>*</tt> as in <tt>SELECT * FROM</tt>, but can be changed if you, for example, want to do a join but not include the joined columns."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:as</tt>: Specifies a polymorphic interface (See <tt>#belongs_to</tt>)."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:through</tt>: Specifies a Join Model through which to perform the query. Options for <tt>:class_name</tt> and <tt>:foreign_key</tt> are ignored, as the association uses the source reflection. You can only use a <tt>:through</tt> query through a <tt>belongs_to</tt> or <tt>has_many</tt> association on the join model."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:source</tt>: Specifies the source association name used by <tt>has_many :through</tt> queries. Only use it if the name cannot be inferred from the association. <tt>has_many :subscribers, :through =&gt; :subscriptions</tt> will look for either <tt>:subscribers</tt> or <tt>:subscriber</tt> on <tt>Subscription</tt>, unless a <tt>:source</tt> is given."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:source_type</tt>: Specifies type of the source association used by <tt>has_many :through</tt> queries where the source association is a polymorphic <tt>belongs_to</tt>."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:uniq</tt> - if set to <tt>true</tt>, duplicates will be omitted from the collection. Useful in conjunction with <tt>:through</tt>.
