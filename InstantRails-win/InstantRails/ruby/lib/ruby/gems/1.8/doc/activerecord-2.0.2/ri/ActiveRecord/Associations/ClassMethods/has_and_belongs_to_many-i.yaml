- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Associates two classes via an intermediate join table. Unless the join table is explicitly specified as an option, it is guessed using the lexical order of the class names. So a join between <tt>Developer</tt> and <tt>Project</tt> will give the default join table name of <tt>developers_projects</tt> because &quot;D&quot; outranks &quot;P&quot;. Note that this precedence is calculated using the <tt>&lt;</tt> operator for <tt>String</tt>. This means that if the strings are of different lengths, and the strings are equal when compared up to the shortest length, then the longer string is considered of higher lexical precedence than the shorter one. For example, one would expect the tables <tt>paper_boxes</tt> and <tt>papers</tt> to generate a join table name of <tt>papers_paper_boxes</tt> because of the length of the name <tt>paper_boxes</tt>, but it in fact generates a join table name of <tt>paper_boxes_papers</tt>. Be aware of this caveat, and use the custom <tt>join_table</tt> option if you need to.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Deprecated: Any additional fields added to the join table will be placed as attributes when pulling records out through <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many</tt> associations. Records returned from join tables with additional attributes will be marked as <tt>ReadOnly</tt> (because we can't save changes to the additional attributes). It's strongly recommended that you upgrade any associations with attributes to a real join model (see introduction)."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Adds the following methods for retrieval and query: <tt>collection</tt> is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument, so <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many :categories</tt> would add among others <tt>categories.empty?</tt>."

    body: <tt>collection(force_reload = false)</tt> - returns an array of all the associated objects. An empty array is returned if none are found.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection&lt;&lt;(object, ...)</tt> - adds one or more objects to the collection by creating associations in the join table (<tt>collection.push</tt> and <tt>collection.concat</tt> are aliases to this method).
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.delete(object, ...)</tt> - removes one or more objects from the collection by removing their associations from the join table. This does not destroy the objects.

    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection=objects</tt> - replaces the collection's content by deleting and adding objects as appropriate.

  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.clear</tt> - removes every object from the collection. This does not destroy the objects.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.empty?</tt> - returns <tt>true</tt> if there are no associated objects.

  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.find(id)</tt> - finds an associated object responding to the <tt>id</tt> and that meets the condition that it has to be associated with this object.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.build(attributes = {})</tt> - returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated with <tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through the join table, but has not yet been saved.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>collection.create(attributes = {})</tt> - returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated with <tt>attributes</tt>, linked to this object through the join table, and that has already been saved (if it passed the validation).

    body: <tt>:class_name</tt> - specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred from the association name. So <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many :projects</tt> will by default be linked to the <tt>Project</tt> class, but if the real class name is <tt>SuperProject</tt>, you'll have to specify it with this option.
