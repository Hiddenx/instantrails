- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: A very simple little class for doing some basic fast statistics sampling. You feed it either samples of numeric data you want measured or you call Stats.tick to get it to add a time delta between the last time you called it. When you're done either call sum, sumsq, n, min, max, mean or sd to get the information. The other option is to just call dump and see everything.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: It does all of this very fast and doesn't take up any memory since the samples are not stored but instead all the values are calculated on the fly.
