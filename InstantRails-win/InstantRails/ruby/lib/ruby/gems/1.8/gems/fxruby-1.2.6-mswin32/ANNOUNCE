I am pleased to announce the latest release of FXRuby, the Ruby language bindings for the FOX GUI toolkit. FOX is a C++-based toolkit for developing graphical user interfaces easily and effectively. It offers a wide, and growing, collection of widgets, and provides state-of-the-art facilities such as drag-and-drop, selection, as well as OpenGL widgets for 3-D graphical manipulation. FOX also implements icons, images, and user-convenience features such as status line help and tooltips.

Please see the comments on the home page concerning any problems with this release, or the change log:

    http://www.fxruby.org/doc/changes.html

to see what has changed since the previous release.

The FXRuby home page is here:

    http://www.fxruby.org

and the source tarball can be downloaded from the RubyForge site:

    http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=300

A binary installer for Windows, compatible with the latest one-click Ruby installer, is also available at the download site.

Note that this release of FXRuby depends on FOX version 1.2.x, which can be downloaded from the FOX downloads page here:
