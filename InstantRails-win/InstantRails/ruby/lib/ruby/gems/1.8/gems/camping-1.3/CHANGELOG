* bin/camping: an application launcher.
* <tt>Camping.run(request, response)</tt> now changed to <tt>controller = Camping.run(request, env)</tt>
* This means outputting the response is the wrapper/server's job.  See bin/camping, you can do a controller.to_s at the least.
* <tt>Controllers::Base.env</tt> is the new thread-safe home for <tt>ENV</tt>.
* The input hash now works more like Rails params.  You can call keys
  like methods or with symbols or strings.
* Queries are now parsed more like PHP/Rails, in that you can denote
  structure with brackets: post[user]=_why;post[id]=2
* Auto-prefix table names, to help prevent name clash.
* Helpers.errors_for simple validation.
* Lots of empty :href and :action attributes, a bug.
* New single-page flipbook RDoc template.
