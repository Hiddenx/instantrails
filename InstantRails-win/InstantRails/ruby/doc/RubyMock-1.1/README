Ruby/Mock 1.1 - Mock objects for the RubyUnit framework
=======================================================

Introduction
------------

Ruby/Mock is an extension to the RUnit framework to make it easy to implement
Mock Objects. Information about Mock Objects can be found online at
http://www.mockobjects.com.

Ruby/Mock was written by Nat Pryce (nat.pryce@b13media.com).

Thanks to:
  * Steve Freeman for suggestions.
  * Morohoshi Akihiko for providing a patch to pass blocks to mocked methods 
    with fixed arity.

Please send comments, suggestions and bug reports to the author.


Installation
------------

1) Unpack the archive.  That will create a directory called mock-1.1/
   containing the Ruby/Mock package, the license, this README file and
   some demo programs.
2) Cd into the mock-1.1/ directory.
3) Run the unit tests for the package to check that it works on your
   platform:  
       % ruby test_mock.rb
   Ruby/Mock is completely platform independent, so the tests should
   all pass.  If they do not, please send a bug report to the author
   containing the test output.
4) Add the mock-1.1/ directory to your RUBYLIB path or copy the mock.rb
   file to your site-ruby directory.
5) Happy mocking!


Usage
-----

The unit tests of the Ruby/Mock package, in the test_mock.rb file, illustrate
and tests each feature of the package.

The demo/ directory contains commented examples.
