    body: "Pushes back one character (passed as a parameter) onto <em>ios</em>, such that a
      subsequent buffered read will return it. Only one character may be pushed back
      before a subsequent read operation (that is, you will be able to read only the
      last of several characters that have been pushed back). Has no effect with
      unbuffered reads (such as <tt>IO#sysread</tt>)."
