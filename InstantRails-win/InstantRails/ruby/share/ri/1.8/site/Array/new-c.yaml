    body: "Returns a new array. In the first form, the new array is empty. In the second it
      is created with <em>size</em> copies of <em>obj</em> (that is, <em>size</em>
      references to the same <em>obj</em>). The third form creates a copy of the array
      passed as a parameter (the array is generated by calling to_ary on the
      parameter). In the last form, an array of the given size is created. Each
      element in this array is calculated by passing the element's index to the given
      block and storing the return value."
