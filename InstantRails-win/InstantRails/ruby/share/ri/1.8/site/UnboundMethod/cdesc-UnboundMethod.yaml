    body: "Ruby supports two forms of objectified methods. Class <tt>Method</tt> is used to
      represent methods that are associated with a particular object: these method
      objects are bound to that object. Bound method objects for an object can be
      created using <tt>Object#method</tt>."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Ruby also supports unbound methods; methods objects that are not associated with a particular object. These can be created either by calling <tt>Module#instance_method</tt> or by calling <tt>unbind</tt> on a bound method object. The result of both of these is an <tt>UnboundMethod</tt> object.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "Unbound methods can only be called after they are bound to an object. That
      object must be be a kind_of? the method's original class."

    body: "Unbound methods are a reference to the method at the time it was objectified:
      subsequent changes to the underlying class will not affect the unbound method."
