    body: "Returns the successor to <em>str</em>. The successor is calculated by
      incrementing characters starting from the rightmost alphanumeric (or the
      rightmost character if there are no alphanumerics) in the string. Incrementing a
      digit always results in another digit, and incrementing a letter results in
      another letter of the same case. Incrementing nonalphanumerics uses the
      underlying character set's collating sequence."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "If the increment generates a ``carry,'' the character to the left of it is
      incremented. This process repeats until there is no carry, adding an additional
      character if necessary."
