    body: "Creates a LogDevice object, which is the target for log messages. Rolling of log
      files is supported (only if a filename is given; you can't roll an IO object).
      The beginning of each file created by this class is tagged with a header
      message."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: This class is unlikely to be used directly; it is a backend for Logger.
