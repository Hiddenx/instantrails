       Uses the integer <em>aCmd</em> to perform various tests on
       <em>file1</em> (first table below) or on <em>file1</em> and
       <em>file2</em> (second table).

       File tests on a single file:

         Test   Returns   Meaning
          ?A  | Time    | Last access time for file1
          ?b  | boolean | True if file1 is a block device
          ?c  | boolean | True if file1 is a character device
          ?C  | Time    | Last change time for file1
          ?d  | boolean | True if file1 exists and is a directory
          ?e  | boolean | True if file1 exists
          ?f  | boolean | True if file1 exists and is a regular file
          ?g  | boolean | True if files has the \CF{setgid} bit
              |         | set (false under NT)
          ?G  | boolean | True if file1 exists and has a group
              |         | ownership equal to the caller's group
          ?k  | boolean | True if file1 exists and has the sticky bit set
          ?l  | boolean | True if files exists and is a symbolic link
          ?M  | Time    | Last modification time for file1
          ?o  | boolean | True if files exists and is owned by
              |         | the caller's effective uid
          ?O  | boolean | True if file1 exists and is owned by
              |         | the caller's real uid
          ?p  | boolean | True if file1 exists and is a fifo
          ?r  | boolean | True if file1 is readable by the effective
              |         | uid/gid of the caller
          ?R  | boolean | True if file is readable by the real
              |         | uid/gid of the caller
          ?s  | int/nil | If files has nonzero size, return the size,
              |         | otherwise return nil
          ?S  | boolean | True if file1 exists and is a socket
          ?u  | boolean | True if file1 has the setuid bit set
          ?w  | boolean | True if file1 exists and is writable by
              |         | the effective uid/gid
          ?W  | boolean | True if file1 exists and is writable by
              |         | the real uid/gid
          ?x  | boolean | True if file1 exists and is executable by
              |         | the effective uid/gid
          ?X  | boolean | True if file1 exists and is executable by
              |         | the real uid/gid
          ?z  | boolean | True if file1 exists and has a zero length

          ?-  | boolean | True if file1 is a hard link to file2
          ?=  | boolean | True if the modification times of file1
              |         | and file2 are equal
