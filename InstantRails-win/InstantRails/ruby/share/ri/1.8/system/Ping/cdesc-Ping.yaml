  text: DESCRIPTION
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: " This module contains routines to test for the reachability of remote hosts.\n Currently the only routine implemented is pingecho().\n\n pingecho() uses a TCP echo (<em>not</em> an ICMP echo) to determine if the\n remote host is reachable. This is usually adequate to tell that a remote\n host is available to rsh(1), ftp(1), or telnet(1) to.\n"

- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB
