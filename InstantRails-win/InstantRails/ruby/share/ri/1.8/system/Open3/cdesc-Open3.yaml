  body: "Usage:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  require &quot;open3&quot;\n\n  stdin, stdout, stderr = Open3.popen3('nroff -man')\n"

  body: "or:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  include Open3\n\n  stdin, stdout, stderr = popen3('nroff -man')\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P
