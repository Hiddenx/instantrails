Instant Rails 1.0 -- To Do
==========================

* Why does IR sometimes report that the port 80 is in use when it
  really is not.

* Update mod_scgi to 1.9

* Upgrade to latest version 4.x version of MySQL

* Add c-based mysql driver.

* Add preference item to allow the user to specify his text
  editor of choice.

* Run SCGI/web app in the background as a service.

* Running the One-Click Ruby Installer and installing to the
  Instant Rails ruby directory gets you all the shortcuts and
  associations. Find a way to embed doing this in Instant Rails
  while staying compatible somehow with the cross-platform
  vision of Instant Rails 2.0
